# LL-and-LR-Derivation
Leftmost and Rightmost Derivation in Python.
This code takes 3 input files.
After that reads this files with respect to their types.
Which are input, LL table and LR table. To process LL table tokenizes input to dynamically process input with LL table.
To do that after reading table we call a function to get terminals from it.
LR table does not need such methods but in process it checks the production rules length to process stack related to productions length. 
This project is done with @yusufokkabas.
